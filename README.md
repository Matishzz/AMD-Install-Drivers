* [22.11.2 w10 & w11](https://github.com/Matishzz/AMD-Install-Drivers/releases/tag/AMD-Driver-22.11.2)

🤖 Installation
---------------
To start we have to download the version we want to install, for now I have uploaded to Releases 4 versions of AMD along with its CNext, it is best to make a comparative benchmark with the 4 versions to see which one works best for you, also keep in mind that there are some drivers that are not compatible with some graphics cards so it will be impossible to test them.

* Once we have decided which driver to install 
* Download the Display Driver in case of w10 will be __WT6A_INF__, in w7 is called __W76A_INF__
* All we have to do is open the __Device Manager__ (Win + R = devmgmt.msc)
* Go to the __"Display adapters"__ section, right click on the "__Microsoft Display Adapter__" 
* "__Update Drivers__" and choose the option "__Browse my computer for drivers__"
* This will ask us the location of the driver that we downloaded previously unzipped we will put it
* Activate the option "__Include subfolders__" and click "__Next__", now the driver installation will start

🔧 AMD software installation
---------------
For some reason, if you need the AMD software although it is not recommended, it is possible to install it by means of a simple .msi that gives us the ccc2_install, the only thing we will have to do is to go to the Releases of the driver that you installed and download the "__ccc-next64.msi__" then we will execute the file (it has to be if or if the CNext of the same version that we have otherwise it will throw an error)
